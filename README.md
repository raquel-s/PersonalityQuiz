## Notes

I was having trouble figuring out why my program would not change from the introduction screen to the next screen. I was thinking that it had something to do with the segues, but as I am kinda new to using Xcode I did not know how to fix the segues without messing up my whole program. So I restarted the whole program three times and I got my program to work on the third try.
